# CleanHostel
This project aims to develop an application for hostel students to schedule and manage room cleaning services efficiently. The application addresses the challenges faced by the current management system in scheduling cleaning services due to varying class schedules of students, resulting in improper utilization of resources.
The overall functionality of the project includes:

User registration and login: Students can create accounts, log in, and access their personalized dashboards.
Room cleaning request form: Students can submit cleaning requests, including preferred date and time, instructions, and additional services.
Cleaning schedule management: Requests are matched with available staff members based on preferences and staff availability, optimizing scheduling and minimizing conflicts.
Notifications and reminders: Students receive notifications about their request status and reminders to prepare their rooms for cleaning.
Cleaning staff management: Staff members can update their availability and mark tasks as completed.
Admin panel: Administrators have access to a dedicated panel to manage requests, tasks, and overall application settings.
CSS and JavaScript: CSS is used to design an appealing interface, while JavaScript adds interactivity and enhances user experience through form validation, dynamic updates, and real-time notifications.
It uses PHP ,HTM/CSS ,JAVASCRIPT ,DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
